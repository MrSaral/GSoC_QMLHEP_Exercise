# GSoC_QMLHEP_Exercise
GSoC QMLHEP 2020 exercise questions and my code.


I am Saral Uttamani, CS grad student at Stony Brook University. This repo is my submission for the exercise given by GSoC QMLHEP 2020. I have attached the following files in the repo,
1) gsoc qmlhep exercise.pdf - This file has the tasks assigned
2) MachineLearning.ipynb - Solution to the Machine Learning task
3) training_input.npy - Training input data
4) test_input.npy - Test input data
5) QuantumComputing.ipynb - Solution to the Quantum Computing Task
6) (* Update 1) Project_Proposal_Saral_Uttamani.pdf - Final project proposal submitted. 


I have used Python, Google Collaboratory for this task. I used various Python in-built modules and I would like to thank all the developers for these wonderful libraries like Cirq. 


*Update 1:
I did not make it through. It was a wonderful experience preparing the proposal. I have also attached my proposal if someone wants to refer to it. At the end of the day, GSoC works on pre-existing connections with the organisation, nothing more.
